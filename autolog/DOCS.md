# AutoLog

A logbook for vehicle fuel-ups, running costs and maintenance, with Home
Assistant sensors created automatically over MQTT Discovery.

> The interface is available in **English and Italian**, with metric, US or
> imperial units and a choice of currency.

## Installation

Open the add-on from the sidebar (Ingress): there are no ports to expose and
no password to set — Home Assistant handles authentication.

The database lives at `/data/autolog.db`, inside the add-on's persistent
volume. It survives restarts and updates, and it is included in Home Assistant
backups.

## Language

The language is negotiated from your browser on first load. To change it, open
**Dati → Lingua** (**Data → Language**) and pick one.

Behind Ingress the choice is saved **per Home Assistant user**, so everyone in
the household can use their own language on every device they log in from.

Sensor names in Home Assistant are **not** affected by this setting: they keep
the names listed below, because renaming them would rename your entities and
break their recorded history.

## Units

Under **Data → Units** you can choose metric (km, litres), US customary (miles,
US gallons) or imperial UK (miles, imperial gallons), plus a currency.

The database always stays metric — conversion happens only on display and on
the sensors — so switching units never rewrites a record.

Units are instance-wide, not per user, because they also set the unit of the
Home Assistant sensors. Changing them changes those units, which Home Assistant
will notice in its long-term statistics.

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mqtt_enabled` | `true` | Publish the sensors over MQTT. Set to `false` to use the web interface only. |
| `force_password` | `false` | Re-enable the built-in password even behind Ingress. Only needed if you also expose port 8099 directly. |
| `password` | — | The built-in password, when `force_password` is on. |
| `mqtt_host` | — | Alternative MQTT broker. Leave empty to take the credentials from the Supervisor. |
| `mqtt_port` | `1883` | Port of the alternative broker. |
| `mqtt_username` | — | Username for the alternative broker. |
| `mqtt_password` | — | Password for the alternative broker. |

With the Mosquitto add-on installed there is nothing to configure: the
credentials are requested from the Supervisor at startup.

**A broker is required for the sensors.** Without one the logbook still works,
but nothing appears in Home Assistant — **Data → Home Assistant sensors** tells
you so explicitly rather than leaving you to work it out.

## Entities

Every non-archived vehicle gets a **device** carrying ten sensors:

| Sensor | Unit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Consumo medio | km/L | distance-weighted tank-to-tank average |
| Consumo medio L/100 km | L/100 km | same average, other unit |
| Costo al km | EUR/km | fuel plus other expenses |
| Chilometri totali | km | `total_increasing`, recorded as statistics |
| Litri totali | L | `total_increasing` |
| Spesa totale | EUR | `total_increasing` |
| Spesa del mese | EUR | resets each month |
| Ultimo prezzo al litro | EUR/L | |
| Ultimo rifornimento | timestamp | |
| Prossima scadenza | timestamp | the full reminder list is in the attributes |

Entity names are in Italian regardless of the interface language, for the
reason given above. Numeric sensors declare the correct
`state_class` and `unit_of_measurement`, so Home Assistant records long-term
statistics for them on its own.

Availability is published on `autolog/status`, backed by an MQTT Last Will: if
the add-on stops or crashes the entities become unavailable rather than
holding a stale value.

## Logging a fuel-up from an automation

Publish to `autolog/<vehicle-slug>/cmd/fillup` the same JSON body the REST API
accepts. The slug is the vehicle name, lowercased, with every non-alphanumeric
character replaced by `_` (for example `Van` becomes `van`).

```yaml
action: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: autolog/van/cmd/fillup
  payload: >
    {"date": "{{ now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') }}",
     "odo": {{ states('sensor.car_odometer') | float }},
     "liters": 45.2, "total_cost": 78.40, "full": 1}
```

Omit `date` and today is used. Handy with an NFC tag stuck on the filler flap.

## The position of a fuel-up

The form has two coordinate fields and a **Locate** button that takes the
position from the device's GPS. The button only works when you reach Home
Assistant over a secure connection (`https://`): that is a browser rule, not an
add-on one, and it holds inside a VPN too, because the browser looks at the URL
and not at the tunnel. Over `http://` the button says so instead of failing
silently, and both fields remain fillable by hand.

The `latitude` and `longitude` columns of a Fuelio export are imported, and
coordinates go out again in the CSV export and in the JSON backup.

## Backups

The add-on is included in Home Assistant backups. On top of that, **Dati →
Backup JSON completo** downloads a readable file containing everything, which
can be restored from the same screen.
